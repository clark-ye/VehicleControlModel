# VehicleControlModel
Vehicle Control Simulation model, designed for control algorithm development and testing.

What we expect in this project:
The Vehicle Control Model (VCM)platform focuses on vehicle dynamics simulation and autonomous drive technology. 
It use a pure electric power system and combines it with the by-wire chassis technology. 
It adapt to the mots popular ASAM standard protocol.
Finally, the functional verification of the control system based on this platform is achieved, 
such as by-wire steering, by-wire braking, AD driving simulation, etc.

----
The VCM Platform divided into four parts, that will build a total virtual simulation system.
- vehicle plant model 
- controller 
- driver
- enviroments

## The project development phase planning
This project is from the very beginning,we plan to develop the vehicle control model from zero and step by step.

everyone who wants to join is welcome and helpful.

It will develop most based on matlab/simulink, and compiled to run without Matlab.

### phase 1ï¼š minimum system
goal: create the model topology and first run.it may contain:

      1) 1-Dof Vehicle model ( longitudinal movement)
      2) Longitudinal control system
      3) Basic road

### phase 2: 3-Dof vehicle model with 2D animation. 
it may contain:

      1) bicycle model, with x,y movement and z-axis rotaion
      2) Longitudinal and lateral control system;
      3) 2-D map and animation

### phase 3:Multi-body vehicle model.
      1) Multi-body consist of interconnencted rigid bodies
      2) suspension plant model, wheels and body;
      3) support for suspention control

### phase 4: still under planning
